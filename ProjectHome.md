This project has been retired, because building an RTS game engine without the use of any generic game engine, or, at least, helper libraries, is a little too much for a single person. Furthermore, the platform, APIs and tools have improved over the course of this project (5 years) a lot, so most of the project became outdated.

Futuremesh is a simple military real-time strategy (RTS) game engine designed for HTML5-compatible browsers.

By adding unit definitions, custom graphics, music, sound and levels, one may easily create their own in-browser real-time strategy game.
